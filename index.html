        <p>I was born and raised Illinois. I grew up in a town called Naperville, Illinois.
        I remember back then, all I would do is play outside. Play some capture the flag, kick the can,
        ghost in the graveyard, basketball, football, or pretty much anything else you could think of outside the house.
        I remember our whole family would share one single desktop computer. Being the youngest, I would have
        to wait my turn to use it. I usually just ended up playing outside instead of using the computer.
        Fast-forward to about two decades and I'm in my home gaming and developing on two monitors, two desktops, and one laptop
        at home.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>Things have come a long way and I always like reminiscing where life was when I was a kid. I remember
        wanting to be professional NBA basketball player, a professional poker player, or a drummer for a really cool band. 
        I became none of those things, although I love doing all three on my own time.
        I graduated from UIC with a Biological Sciences degree and became a Microbiologist. I was content with my job, 
        co-workers, and commute. That is until I shadowed my friend at his tech company and coded some
        stuff on codecademy and FreeCodeCamp. The day I learned about the world of coding is when my life became unnecessarily harder than it had to be. 
        I was no longer content with being a Microbiologist. I knew that I wanted to dive into the world of software development.
        </p>

        <br>

        <p> From March 2017 to March 2018 I self-taught myself as much as I could in my spare time. I tried to learn HTML, CSS, Ruby,
        Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, SQL, Git, Algorithms, Big O Notation, Bootstrap, Computer Science Fundamentals, and you get the point.
        I realized I didn't have much time and became scattered-brained at all the new frameworks, languages, books, and resources I was diving into.
        That's when I realized I wanted to get a job out of coding as soon as possible. I joined Northwestern Coding Bootcamp to fast track
        me and get my foot in the door while learning a modern stack. It's not about if, it's about when.
